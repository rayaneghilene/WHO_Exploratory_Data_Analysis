## Introduction

In machine learning, clustering is related to unsupervised learning approaches in which the algorithm fits from the distribution of given data. The main advantage of such methods is the detection
without a priori of patterns, sorting data, and detecting outliers.

The given dataset is a combination of a dataset produced by the **World Health Organization** and the
location of countries. It pooled the evolution of 23 features for 15 years among numerous countries.
One of the goals of this TP is to detect continents and subcontinent.

## Objectives :

- Visualize spatial datasets
- Apply K-Means and GMM on spatial datasets
- Normalize the datasets
- Propose a methodology to detect specific pools of data



## How to use
To use the code in this repository, simply clone the repository and navigate to the folder corresponding to the lab you're interested in. Each lab contains its own set of instructions and code files, which should be self-contained and easy to follow.

The code is written in Python and requires the installation of several Python packages, including Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn...
